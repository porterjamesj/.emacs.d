Mingus is a frontend for GNU Emacs to the Music Player daemon. The
interface closely, though not strictly, resembles that of ncmpc, which
I had been using before (the main drawback of ncmpc for me was itâ€™s
apparent lack of support for unicode). It has some advantages over
other clients, mainly in the field of playlist editing. This is
achieved through marking and regions as you are used too in emacs and
in dired. Mingus also provides a point-of-insertion for inserting new
songs. This can be handy to drop a song after the currently playing
one (enqueue), but is more flexible. Mingus is distributed under the
GPL.

w3m
===
Another plus is its integration with emacs-w3m , in the sense that,
when bumping into a sexy podcast or radio-stream while browsing in
the browser of browsers, you have the ability to add any stream at
point (and play it directly, if so desired).

Dired
=====
Jump from Mingus to song at point in Dired, and, vice versa, add songs
from Dired to the playlist.

Autocompletion on queries
=========================
Mingus has kind of autocompletion on queries. The browser can show
either the song results or their parent directories. This lets you go
easy on the tagging, and make good use of a simple file-system
structured song collection. Mingus can be configured to use ido-mode
completion.

Bookmarking
===========
Mingus with version >= 0.32 (Fleurette Africaine) has bookmarks to
remember filename and position. This can be very useful with
audiobooks or working with language courses.

Global bookmarking shortcuts C-x r b and C-x r m are overwritten in
Mingus' global map to have alike functionality, and C-x r d is set to
mingus-bookmark-delete. The function mingus-bookmark-set (C-x r b)
takes currently playing file + its current elapsed time. Buffer
position is ignored. Mingus-bookmark-jump will jump to a bookmark. It
inserts the file into the current playlist when it is not yet there.

Mingus stays home
=================
If mingus stays home, i.e. the daemon mpd is run from the same
computer as the client, mingus-stays-home.el provides an experimental
cd-burning tool (mingus-burns). When you have
[taggit.el](https://github.com/pft/elisp-assorted/blob/master/taggit.el)
and the command-line [taggit program](https://github.com/ft/taggit)
mingus can call that with a selection of songs to perform (batch) tag
editing.

Prerequisites
=============
libmpdee.el by R. Ramkumar. Currently mingus runs on GNU Emacs22 and
GNU Emacs 23. If you also want to use mingus-stays-home.el, cdrecord (or
any other command-line cd-burning tool taking files as arguments) might
be needed.

ToDo
====
mingus.el
---------
- Add text-properties (fringe-bitmap?) for point-of-insertion
- Add a search buffer In this search buffer, you would be able to
   filter songs by their attributes. It would have a tabular layout,
   and you could safe-sort the songs. Maybe as-you-type, maybe not.
